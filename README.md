# STEMinist web app

This is a small personal project. The aim is to create a Buzzfeed-style quiz (which pizza topping you are based on your fav Taylor Swift songs), except giving the user their STEMinist hero.

So far this is not going to be a real quiz.

Plan to implement in a nutshell:
1. create HTML and CSS tempalte
2. create React app
3. fetching data from the Women in STEM API by <a href="https://github.com/kinlane">Kin Lane</a>
